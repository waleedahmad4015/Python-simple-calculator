# Python Calculator

This is a simple Python-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes user input for the operator and numbers, then computes and prints the result.

## Features

- Supports four basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- User-friendly input prompts for operator and numbers.
- Handles invalid operators gracefully by informing the user.
- Supports floating-point arithmetic for more precise calculations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
2. The program will prompt you to enter an operator. You can choose one of the following:
   - `+` for addition
   - `-` for subtraction
   - `*` for multiplication
   - `/` for division
   
3. After entering a valid operator, you'll be asked to input two numbers.

4. The program will compute and display the result of the operation.

## Example Usage

```bash
Enter an operator (+ - * /) : +
Enter the 1st Number: 10
Enter the 2nd Number: 5
15.0
```

## Error Handling

- If the user enters an invalid operator (anything other than `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`), the program will print an error message:
  ```
  Only these operators are allowed: +, -, *, /
  ```

- For division, if the second number is zero, Python will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. You can add additional error handling for this if needed.
